# Phito Arch
This is a very lightweight library that handles a lot of the boilerplate for the architectures I use.
This includes the following:
* Response wrappers for Retrofit and Apollo API calls
* Interfaces for implementing CLEAN architectures 
* Interfaces and classes for implementing MVI architecture
